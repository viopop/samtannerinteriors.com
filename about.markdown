## About Sam

Sam brings a wealth of knowledge and a down to earth sensibility to her projects, mixing upscale refinement with a fresh, contemporary vibe while always keeping her clients' needs and personalities at the forefront of her designs. She believes that good design is a dynamic process---one that adapts to creative discoveries and expands to incorporate one-of-a-kind finds---and seeks to make that process as fulfilling and fun for her clients as possible.

Some of Sam's earliest design moments had her dabbling in space planning and materials selections when, as a young girl, she frequently rearranged her first bedroom set and the reversible color panels on each of the drawers. After completing her undergraduate degree and spending five years in the corporate world building fundamental business skills, she returned to her creative roots and earned a degree in Interior Design from Interior Designers Institute, a CIDA accredited design school. With a kick-start working as the right hand designer at a highly respected Orange County firm for several years and a handful of her own projects, Sam branched out and established her firm, based in Newport Beach.

When she's not engrossed in client work, Sam and her tribe (husband Jeff + daughters Kentley and Gwen + pup Babs) can be found celebrating the everyday: frequent splashes in the pool, Jeff's wizardry in the kitchen, tinkering with house projects (ground zero test site), paddle boarding the canals, and scheming ways to create beauty in the world.
