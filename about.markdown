  col1_text: Sam brings a wealth of knowledge and a down to earth sensibility to her
    projects, mixing upscale refinement with a fresh, contemporary vibe while always
    keeping her clients' needs and personalities at the forefront of her designs.
    She believes that good design is a dynamic process---one that adapts to creative
    discoveries and expands to incorporate one-of-a-kind finds---and seeks to make
    that process as fulfilling and fun for her clients as possible.
  col2_text: Some of Sam's earliest design moments had her dabbling in space planning
    and materials selections when, as a young girl, she frequently rearranged her
    first bedroom set and the reversible color panels on each of the drawers. After
    completing her undergraduate degree and spending five years in the corporate world
    building fundamental business skills, she returned to her creative roots and earned
    a degree in Interior Design from Interior Designers Institute, a CIDA accredited
    design school. With a kick-start working as the right hand designer at a highly
    respected Orange County firm for several years and a handful of her own projects,
    Sam branched out and established her firm, based in Newport Beach.
  col3_text: 'When she''s not engrossed in client work, Sam and her tribe (husband
    Jeff + daughters Kentley and Gwen + pups Babs and Stella) can be found celebrating
    the everyday: frequent splashes in the pool, Jeff''s wizardry in the kitchen,
    tinkering with house projects (ground zero test site), paddle boarding the canals,
    and scheming ways to create beauty in the world.'
